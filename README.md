This is a simple application to generate images of cats with various quotes based on user selection. There are three options: Nice Cat will generate a cat with an affirming quote on a blue background, Mean Cat will generate a cat with an insulting quote on a red background, and Badass Cat will generate a cat with a Breaking Bad quote on a green background. When the mouse passes over these cats, a border will appear in the respective color, and disappear when the mouse leaves. If the cat is double-clicked, however, the border will stay permanently, unless the cat is double-clicked again.
